# Build and Run your Apps
How to run your apps on Azure?

### Azure App Service  
Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. This works well for Web Apps.

### Azure Container Apps
Azure Container Apps allows you to run containerized applications without worrying about orchestration or infrastructure. This is great for running Microservices and Container instances in a "serverless" way.

### Azure Static Web Apps
Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.
It uses Azure Functions for your API and "backend" to a static web frontend. Support automated CI/CD pipeline, environments etc.

### Azure Functions ("Serverless")
You can use Functions to build web APIs, respond to database changes, process IoT streams, manage message queues, and more.
