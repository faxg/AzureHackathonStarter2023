# Getting started on Azure
If you want to get the best Developer experience, you'll need to following:
- GitHub account (https://github.com)
- Microsoft Azure account (https://portal.azure.com). 

You can also log-in to Azure using your existing __GitHub account__
It's best to use your private e-mail for the accounts, e.g. not your work or university e-mail, as this could lead to some problems with free Azure Credits etc.


Never used Azure before? We recommend to start here:
